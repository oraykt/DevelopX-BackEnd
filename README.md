The basic requirements are the follow:
- Always deliver the lowest number of possible notes;
- Itâ€™s possible to get the amount requested with available notes;
- The client balance is infinite;
- Amount of notes is infinite;
- Available notes $ 100,00; $ 50,00; $ 20,00 e $ 10,00

- Entry: 125.00
  Result: throw NoteUnavailableException
- Entry: -130.00
  Result: throw InvalidArgumentException
- Entry: NULL
  Result: [Empty Set]


### The Solution:

- [withdrawRouter](https://github.com/oraykt/DevelopX-Express/blob/master/routes/withdrawRouter.js) CashMachine Withdraw Service Router
- [withdrawService](https://github.com/oraykt/DevelopX-Express/blob/master/services/withdraw.js) is Business Function
- [checkUserInput](https://github.com/oraykt/DevelopX-Express/blob/master/utils/checkUserInput.js) is Logical Calculation
- [Views](https://github.com/oraykt/DevelopX-Express/tree/master/views) The interface that users use the interface
- [Test](https://github.com/oraykt/DevelopX-Express/blob/master/test/withdrawRouter.js) is the tests

cd DevelopX-Express && npm install && npm start
```
